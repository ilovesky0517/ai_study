    "\n",
    "In most cases, datasets designed for specific tasks are presented along with **evaluation metrics** that can be used for performance evaluation. Similarly, the CRAG dataset provides evaluation metrics that should be used when measuring the performance of LLMs on this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, before proceeding with the evaluation, let’s first check which evaluation methods the creators of the CRAG dataset intended to use. Specifically, we will examine the four answer classification criteria they proposed, understand how these are evaluated, and clarify what each criterion means.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "The creators of the CRAG dataset evaluated RAG based on the following four elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hxmPdi.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, they classified responses that were identical to their predefined answers as the most ideal case. Responses with similar meanings but containing minor errors were classified as the next most ideal case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is that, under the CRAG dataset’s evaluation criteria, everything else is not simply classified as “incorrect.” Instead, the creators expect the LLM to admit when it does not know the answer. Incorrect answers are those containing errors, and the more these answers occur, the worse the model’s performance is considered. However, answers classified as Missing (indicating no answer) do not negatively or positively impact the model’s performance.\n",

However, as the evaluation results can vary depending on the prompt used, we will use the default prompt provided by the creators of the CRAG dataset.\n",

    "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized interface that allows large language models to interact with external tools or data services via a structured client-server protocol. Each function on the server is registered as a tool, and the LLM can invoke these tools by sending structured requests through the MCP client.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/P1g0TPh.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if an external data source can be accessed by the LLM through MCP, this interaction can be viewed as a form of RAG. This is especially relevant in our scenario, where the knowledge graph is only partially accessible via APIs. In such cases, instead of relying on a pre-defined decision tree, it might be more effective to let the LLM decide which tools to use dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the LLM itself selects the appropriate tool to retrieve specific information from the knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this, it is crucial to define which tools are available to the LLM. This is handled on the MCP server side, where each tool is registered along with a description that helps the model understand what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EiQfJxQ.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP server consists of core tool definitions and server-side settings that together define the server’s behavior.  Thus, we exclude server execution from this exercise, but you can refer to the attached code for implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can leverage the same tools we used previously, such as llamaindex, to construct the MCP client. Refer to the code below to see how the MCP client can be implemented.\n",

    "### MCP Server Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MCP (Model-Context-Program) Server** serves as the execution and data layer that interfaces directly with the LLM. It exposes customized functionality and structured contextual information through three main elements: **Resources**, **Tools**, and **Prompts**. This enables LLMs to make informed, context-aware decisions and perform real-world operations safely and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCP Context Components\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Resource\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Resource** provides structured, external data that the LLM can reference during reasoning or decision-making. It represents external objects—such as datasets, files, graph nodes, or static configuration tables—that are read-only from the model's perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties:**\n",
    "- `name`: Human-readable name shown to users or in debugging.\n",
    "- `description`: A short summary explaining the resource's purpose.\n",
    "- `mime_type`: The MIME type of the content (e.g., `text/plain`, `application/json`). This describes the content format.\n",
    "- `uri`: A globally unique identifier for the resource.\n",
    "- `content`: The actual data or a pointer to the data (e.g., a JSON object, string, or file reference).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Notes:**\n",
    "- Resources are **not invoked** like functions.\n",
    "- They are **fetched by URI**, and remain **static** so that the LLM can repeatedly refer to them without reloading.\n",
    "- Resources improve LLM accuracy by anchoring it to reliable external context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Tool** is a callable function registered on the MCP server that the LLM can use to interact with the outside world. These tools bridge natural language instructions and real-world effects by turning a model’s intent into executable actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Use Cases:**\n",
    "- Executing database queries\n",
    "- Fetching live data from APIs\n",
    "- Performing calculations or summarizations\n",
    "- Searching documents or files\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. The user provides a natural language input (e.g., “Please calculate 3 + 7”).\n",
    "2. The MCP client supplies the LLM with a list of available tools and their schema.\n",
    "3. The LLM chooses the appropriate tool and extracts input arguments (e.g., `x=3`, `y=7`).\n",
    "4. The tool invocation is generated and passed to the MCP server.\n",
    "5. The tool is executed on the server, and the result is returned.\n",
    "6. The LLM incorporates the result into its context to generate a final user response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "Tools are registered using the `@mcp.tool()` decorator in Python, and must conform to the function signature and type schema required by the MCP framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Prompt** in MCP serves as a reusable, templated instruction that guides the LLM’s reasoning in a structured way. Prompts help the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpret ambiguous user queries\n",
    "- Structure downstream tool invocations\n",
    "- Extract relevant content from complex input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Usage Scenarios:**\n",
    "- Generate structured summaries from unstructured context\n",
    "- Classify user intent\n",
    "- Disambiguate time references like “this year” or “last quarter”\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts act as templates or procedural guides that the LLM fills in dynamically based on user input and context. While not executable like tools, they play a key role in shaping how the LLM prepares inputs and interprets outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Purpose |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| `Resource` | Static external data that LLM can reference |\n",
    "| `Tool`     | Callable function to perform real-world actions |\n",
    "| `Prompt`   | Structured, reusable guide for reasoning or template generation |\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these elements form the foundation of the **MCP Server**, enabling LLMs to operate safely, reliably, and contextually in real applications."

    "\n",
    "While MCP allows LLMs to dynamically select and invoke tools using a standardized interface, real-world usage has revealed several practical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Overflow**: Tool outputs are inserted directly into the model's input context. If the result is too long, it may exceed the model’s token limit and lead to failure.\n",
    "- **Limited Error Recovery**: When tool execution fails or exceeds limits, LLMs often cannot recover or retry unless explicitly guided to do so.\n",
    "- **Debugging Difficulty**: Since tool selection and reasoning are tightly coupled inside the model, it is difficult to trace what went wrong without detailed logs or event streaming.\n",
    "- **Latency and Reliability**: Each tool call requires a round-trip to the server. In multi-step workflows, this can introduce significant delay and failure points.\n",
    "- **Loss of Developer Control**: Tool behavior is driven by the LLM’s interpretation of the prompt and available tools, making behavior harder to predict or constrain.\n",

    "Understanding these trade-offs is key to using MCP effectively in real-world LLM applications."
