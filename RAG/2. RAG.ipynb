A higher temperature increases the randomness, resulting in more varied and unpredictable text. Conversely, a lower temperature makes the model's responses more deterministic and predictable, often sticking closer to the most likely outcomes.  \n","\n","**Top-p**: This parameter helps in controlling the diversity of the model's responses by focusing on the most probable tokens. Top-p sets a threshold to consider the top tokens up to the point where their cumulative probability exceeds a specified value p. This way, the model filters out less likely tokens and focuses only on a subset of the most probable tokens, which helps in generating coherent and contextually relevant outputs.\n","\n","```Python\n","        response = oai_client.chat.completions.create(\n","            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n","            temperature=0, #change this value\n","            top_p=0, #change this value\n","            messages=messages,\n","        )\n","```\n","\n","**Different Embedding Function**: Using more advanced embedding models could capture the meanings of tokens more effectively, potentially allowing for more accurate retrieval.\n","\n","Increasing the dimensionality of embedding vectors can enable them to capture more information, thus improving their ability to find semantically similar passages. However, this might also lead to overfitting and make it difficult to measure similarities due to diluted data distribution across dimensions, i.e., curse of dimensionality.\n","\n","Conversely, reducing the dimensions of vectors can increase computational efficiency and prevent overfitting. Yet, overly small dimensions may not capture enough information, leading to degraded performance.\n","\n","```Python\n","from llama_index.core import Settings\n","\n","# Option 1. global default\n","Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding()\n","\n","# Option 2. local model\n","Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(\n","    model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\" #change this to the local path or huggingface model name\n",")\n","\n","#per-index\n","index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, embed_model=embed_model)\n","```\n","\n","Therefore, by using one of the above codes, you can adjust the embedding function and the dimension of the embedding vector to improve the performance of the RAG\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/truera/trulens/blob/main/trulens_eval/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb","timestamp":1711609044141}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
