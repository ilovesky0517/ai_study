    "#📓 TASK #1: WEB-BASED RETRIEVAL SUMMARIZATION\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will tackle the first task of the KDD Cup: Web-based Retrieval Summarization. Since the KDD Cup CRAG benchmark fundamentally focuses on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), our approach will also be based on the RAG framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the RAG system, let’s first clarify what problem we need to solve. At first, participants receive 5 web pages per question, potentially containing relevant information. And the objective is to measure the systems' capability to identify and condense this information into accurate answers.\n",

    "\n",
    "By looking at the diagram above, you will get an idea of what problem we need to solve. Additionally, since you have already reviewed the input data in previous sessions, you are well aware of the types of data you will be working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall, the CRAG dataset contains many challenging questions, and as we observed earlier, it is difficult for the LLM alone to solve these problems effectively. Therefore, we will explore how these types of problems can be addressed using the RAG framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, This practice class will be comprised of four sections.  \n",
    "  \n",

    "## I. Implementing a Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the RAG system, the first essential component we need is the **Retriever**. As you are already familiar, the retriever is a crucial element for building an effective RAG. If the retriever successfully retrieves a sufficient amount of relevant information and passes it to the LLM, the probability of the LLM generating the correct answer will significantly increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we only experimented with the default retriever provided by `LlamaIndex` and made minor adjustments, such as modifying the chunk size.   \n",
    "This time, however, we will define the retriever in a more low-level manner and explore its use step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is divided into the following four stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preparing Python Packages\n",
    "2. Implementing a Chunk Extractor\n",

      "rank 1: [120] When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004, he helped the Suns improve from a 29–53 record in 2003–04 to 62–20 in 2004–05, reaching the conference finals for the first time in 11 years, and earning his first MVP award. The next season, he again led the Suns to the conference finals, despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, Kurt Thomas , and Brian Grant ). Further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring.

    "## II. Implementing a Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will design the **Reader**.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the most important considerations when creating a Reader? The most crucial factor is likely the choice of LLM. Factors such as model size, performance on reasoning benchmarks, cost, and other considerations are typically part of the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we have limited options for the LLMs we can use in this practice session, this will not be a consideration for us here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what’s the next most important factor? **Prompt design**. It is well known that well-designed prompts lead to better results from the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, setting an appropriate prompt becomes even more critical for the CRAG dataset. In this task, the LLM must be able to answer “I don’t know” if it encounters something it is unsure about or cannot answer confidently. To achieve this, the prompt must be specifically designed to guide the LLM to behave in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this exercise will be conducted in the following three main stages:\n",

    "1. Design a Prompt Template\n",
    "2. Implement a Prompt Generator\n",
    "3. Implement a Reader"

    "\n",
    "To design an effective prompt template, we need to carefully consider certain factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe response must be generated based on the given question and references.\n",
    "2.\tIn the CRAG benchmark, answers should not be too long or verbose. During evaluation, only the first 75 tokens are used for scoring, so the response needs to be concise.\n",
    "3.\tThe LLM must be able to recognize questions it cannot answer and respond with “I don’t know”.\n",

      "0: But it wasn’t until 1991’s Beauty and the Beast that an animated film was nominated for best picture. Throughout the ’90s, the Oscars resisted adding a category for animated features, though John Lasseter received a special achievement award in 1996 “for his inspired leadership of the Pixar Toy Story team, resulting in the first feature-length computer-animated film.” In 2001, the Academy finally added a category for best animated feature. Shrek became the first winner in 2002. This year, we had a close contest for best animated feature film between The Boy and the Heron , which won in this category at the BAFTA Awards in London on Feb. 18, and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

      "1: [9] In business culture [ edit ] The P/E ratio of a company is a major focus for many managers. They are usually paid in company stock or options on their company's stock (a form of payment that is supposed to align the interests of management with the interests of other stock holders). The stock price can increase in one of two ways: either through improved earnings or through an improved multiple that the market assigns to those earnings. In turn, the primary drivers for multiples such as the P/E ratio is through higher and more sustained earnings growth rates. Consequently, managers have strong incentives to boost earnings per share, even in the short term, and/or improve long-term growth rates. This can influence business decisions in several ways: If a company wants to acquire companies with a higher P/E ratio than its own, it usually prefers paying in cash or debt rather than in stock. Though in theory the method of payment makes no difference to value, doing it this way offsets or avoids earnings dilution (see accretion/dilution analysis ). Conversely, companies with higher P/E ratios than their targets are more tempted to use their stock to pay for acquisitions. Companies with high P/E ratios but volatile earnings may be tempted to find ways to smooth earnings and diversify risk—this is the theory behind building conglomerates . Conversely, companies with low P/E ratios may be tempted to acquire small high-growth businesses in an effort to \"rebrand\" their portfolio of activities and burnish their image as growth stocks and thus obtain a higher PE rating. Companies try to smooth earnings, for example by \" slush fund accounting\" (hiding excess earnings in good years to cover for losses in lean years). Such measures are designed to create the image that the company always slowly but steadily increases profits, with the goal to increase the P/E ratio. Companies with low P/E ratios are usually more open to leveraging their balance sheet. As seen above, this mechanically lowers the P/E ratio, which means the company looks cheaper than it did before leverage, and also improves earnings growth rates. Both of these factors help drive up the share price. Strictly speaking, the ratio is measured in years, since the price is measured in dollars and earnings are measured in dollars per year. Therefore, the ratio demonstrates how many years it takes to cover the price, if earnings stay the same.\n",
      "2: Decide, based on its value, if they should buy, sell or hold any particular stock. “PE ratio” may sound technical, but it’s really just a comparison of how the public feels about a company (its stock price) and how well the company is actually doing (its EPS). The reading (and its inferences) can also be applied to market indexes, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq. PE ratio example Here’s one scenario: A company posts stable profits quarter after quarter, and its projected profits are equally stable. If its stock price jumps but its earnings stay the same (and no earnings increases are expected), the company’s intrinsic value didn’t change; the market’s perception of the company did. In this instance, the earnings in the PE ratio stayed the same, while the price soared, which mathematically sends the overall PE ratio higher. If a company’s PE ratio is significantly higher than its peers, there’s a chance the stock is overvalued. Another way to understand PE ratio: It’s a measure of how much investors are paying for every $1 of a company’s earnings. Imagine two similar companies in the same sector. One has a share price of $100 and a PE ratio of 15. The other has a share price of $50 and a PE ratio of 30. The first company’s share price may be higher, but a PE ratio of 15 means you’re only paying $15 for every $1 of the company’s earnings. Investors in the company with a PE ratio of 30 are paying $30 for $1 of earnings. PE ratio formula To arrive at a company’s PE ratio, you’ll need to first know its EPS, which is calculated by dividing the company’s net profits by the number of shares of common stock it has outstanding. Once you have that, you can divide the company’s current share price by its EPS. For example, if a company has earnings of $10 billion and has 2 billion shares outstanding, its EPS is $5. If its stock price is currently $120, its PE ratio would be 120 divided by 5, which comes out to 24. One way to put it is that the stock is trading 24 times higher than the company’s earnings, or 24x.\n",

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
